# philosophers
In computer science, the dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.

It was originally formulated in 1965 by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra'>Edsger Dijkstra</a> as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers competing for access to tape drive peripherals. Soon after, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare'>Tony Hoare</a> gave the problem its present formulation:

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher at a time and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can only take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available and they cannot start eating before getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

The problem is how to design a discipline of behavior (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

This exercise is part of the basic curriculum at <a href='https://www.42sp.org.br/'>42 SÃ£o Paulo</a>.

  **September 11th 2021** - I set up the project structure and Makefile, as well as some standard input error handling. I still have to figure out exactly how I'm going to approach this.

  **September 22th 2021** - Still structuring the project and started playing with threads. Don't really know how I'm gonna do this yet.

  **September 22th 2021** - Philosophers are now threads and they "take turns" thinking. Tomorrow I will try to implement their actual eating/sleeping/thinking routine. Maybe organize my files a little bit.

  **September 27th 2021** - Now the philosophers eat/think/sleep, but the files are still a mess. I'm gonna fix it later. Gotta figure out mutexes now.

  **September 29th 2021** - Mutexes/forks implemented, and we're starting to count time. REALLY need to refactor to clean up. Having occasional deadlocks that need to be addressed.

  **October 4th 2021** - Philosophers now starve to death as they should. Code still looks like a messy heap of garbage. Allocated everything on the stack because I don't wanna deal with mallocs.

  **October 5th 2021** - Implemented satiation mechanics, and technically the project is "done". Still got some bugs to deal with, deadlocks when the simulation runs with two Philosophers, and the infamous 410 parameter causes an unknown-crash.

  **October 6th 2021** - Fixed the last bugs apparently. Now I only need to refactor the program and make it norme-compliant, and maybe a little prettier.

  **October 8th 2021** - Program is ready, passing tests and everything, norme is OK. Adding a delay meter to the repo to make the evaluations easier. I'm not done yet though, I wanna make it a little prettier, a little more interesting. Make it a little fancier.

  **October 9th 2021** - Making a bit of a mess on a separate branch, trying to implement a fancy naming system for my philosophers. It's not really working, so I'm gonna debug in the morning.
  
  - Was successful in my little experiment. I've used the current computer time as a seed for a random number generator, which picks a name from a list on an external file, and uses it instead of an index to identify the philosophers. The names that are already taken are saved on a linked list to avoid repetition. I've also made the text colorful to identify actions more easily. Pretty happy with the result, just want to clean up the code a little bit more before getting my evaluations.

  - Project is clean. Made a "strict" branch in case an evaluator decides to be a fussy little nerd and give me trouble for using the fcntl.h and open/close system calls. That's all, folks!
